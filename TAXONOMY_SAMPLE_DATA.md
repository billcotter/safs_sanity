## How to Test:

1. **Create Taxonomy Items**: Use the data above to create genres, tags, and collections
2. **Edit Existing Films**: Add genre and tag references to your existing films
3. **Create Enhanced Film**: Try creating a new "Enhanced Film" with full taxonomy
4. **Test Relationships**: Create a collection and reference films in it

## Expected Results:

- Sanity Studio should show new document types: Genre, Film Tag, Collection
- You should be able to create references between documents
- Preview text should show relationships (e.g., "Film Noir > Drama")
- Enhanced schemas should offer comprehensive categorization options

## Verification Steps:

1. âœ… Create a Genre â†’ Should appear in Genre list
2. âœ… Create a Film Tag â†’ Should appear in Film Tag list
3. âœ… Create a Collection â†’ Should appear in Collection list
4. âœ… Edit a Film â†’ Should see new taxonomy reference fields
5. âœ… Create Enhanced Film â†’ Should see full taxonomy options

This sample data will give you a solid foundation to understand how the taxonomy system works and how it can enhance your film society's content organization! ðŸŽ¬
